## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

One of my favorite apps is Spotify because it recommends when you scroll to the bottom of a playlist other playlists that are similar. 
A second favorite app is Pintrest because when you open the app it always generates a inspirational feed based on my saved and liked posts.
A third favorite app is Dice because it has a interative top bar when you open the app that has different categories for various concerts in my area.

An app that I would like to improve is the ios mail app. The reason is because I would like to change the landing page of the app. It is sometimes overwhelming opening up the app to my inbox. As a result, I would be interested in making a more simpler landing page for users to pick where they want to go instead of making inbox the deault page when one opens the app.. 

## Notes

Some challenges that I encountered is just getting used to using Xcode. It is an unfamiliar application for me as I used Visual Studio Code, so it took some getting used to.
